          Dipesh Sagvekar
          <br />CEO & Founder, HK Transport
        </h2>

        <h3>
          If you interested in running a transport business with minimum
          investment, we will share everything about this business with you &
          also share how much actual budget and documents are required to start
          a profitable transport business in India. There are three types of
          doing this business which are explained in detail below.
        </h3>
        <div class="blog-content">
          <h2>1. Owning A Truck</h2>
          <h3>
            This type is also called as Truck Transport Business, which is also
            done by most of the people in India. Everyone thinks it is very easy
            to do as it only needs to buy a truck & then we have to give it on
            lease but let me tell you that it also has few risks to handle like
            sometimes the truck owner doesn't gets return load for the vehicle
            by which he has to bring it back empty & also cases like accidents
            but still as we know that every business has risks to deal with but
            still truck transportation business is a very profitable business to
            start if you have strong network. You can buy any truck from one
            small Tata Ace to big Tata Signa depends on your budget but before
            starting truck transportation business you should first look for
            manufacturing companies around your area becuase they are going to
            provide you the load for your truck to transport from one place to
            another. You should also decide that which route you are going to
            drive your truck. Owning a truck and giving it on a lease to a
            company with a contract is also the better way to start this
            business and earn more profit. If you are still confused about this
            topic, feel free to contact us. We will consult you for starting a
            truck transport business in India.
          </h3>

          <h2>2. Starting A Booking Company</h2>
          <h3>
            This type of business is best for people who has a budget of atleast
            1 lakh and above. Booking company signs a contract with
            manufacturing companies to provide them truck for the specific
            period of time at a given price. The main thing they provide is to
            give credit of 1 month to those companies they had a contract. For
            Eg. A manufacturer has signed a contract with booking company to
            transport his material from Mumbai to Gujarat. Lets suppose the
            vehicle in this case is 17 feet truck & the trip cost is ₹20,000. So
            now the booking company will have to contact truck owners or brokers
            & get the vehicle below ₹20,000. Lets suppose booking company gets
            it for ₹17,000. Now booking company will assign the truck for
            manufacturer and in between the commission he earns is ₹3000. So if
            booking company gets 10 trucks orders monthly from the manufacturer
            then he will earn ₹30000 Per Month from this business. Only the
            thing in this case is booking company allows credit of one month to
            manufacturer which is why booking company needs more capital to
            start. If you are still confused about this topic, feel free to
            contact us. We will consult you for starting a truck transport
            business in India.
          </h3>

          <h2>3. To Be A Broker Or Commission Agent</h2>
          <h3>
            This type of business needs a budget of minimum ₹2000 to maximum
            ₹10000. This business is best for people who wants to start
            transport business in low investment. Even GST is not compulsory if
            you are starting as a broker or commission agent. The only work of
            broker is to have network of truck owners with him. Broker must have
            good relations with truck owners. There are two ways of earning for
            a broker. First, by connecting with booking company and providing
            them trucks and earning commission upto ₹1000 and second, by
            marketing his website on internet and getting direct customers. For
            eg. A customer contacts a broker to transport his goods of 300kgs
            from Mumbai to Bangalore and broker charges him ₹8000. Then broker
            will contact the truck owner whose route is Mumbai to Bangalore and
            have to assign the load below ₹8000. Lets suppose broker assigned it
            for ₹6000. Here he will earn ₹2000 commission in between. This
            business is so simple to do & some people in India are doing it
            without having an office. If you are still confused about this
            topic, feel free to contact us. We will consult you for starting a
            truck transport business in India.
